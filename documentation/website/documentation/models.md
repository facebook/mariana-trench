The main way to configure the analysis is through defining models for methods.

## Models

A model is an abstract representation of how data flows through a method.

A model essentialy consists of:
* [Sources](#sources): a set of sources that the method produces or receives on parameters;
* [Sinks](#sinks): a set of sinks on the method;
* [Propagation](#propagation): a description of how the method propagates taint coming into it (e.g, the first parameter updates the second, the second parameter updates the return value, etc.);
* [Attach to Sources](#attach-to-sources): a set of features/breadcrumbs to add on an any sources flowing out of the method;
* [Attach to Sinks](#attach-to-sinks): a set of features/breadcrumbs to add on sinks of a given parameter;
* [Attach to Propagations](#attach-to-propagations): a set of features/breadcrumbs to add on propagations for a given parameter or return value;
* [Add Features to Arguments](#add-features-to-arguments): a set of features/breadcrumbs to add on any taint that might flow in a given parameter;
* [Modes](#modes): a set of flags describing specific behaviors (see below).

Models can be specified in JSON. For example to mark the string parameter to our `Logger.log` function as a sink we can specify it as
```json
{
  "method" : "Lcom/example/Logger;.log:(Ljava/lang/String;)V",
  "sinks" : [
    {
      "kind" : "Logging",
      "port" : "Argument(1)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the naming of methods follow the [Dalvik's bytecode format](#method-name-format).

### Method name format

The format used for method names is:

`<className>.<methodName>:(<parameterType1><parameterType2>)<returnType>`

Example: `Landroidx/fragment/app/Fragment;.startActivity:(Landroid/content/Intent;)V`


For the parameters and return types use the following table to pick the correct one (please refer to [JVM doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2-200) for more details)

* V - void
* Z - boolean
* B - byte
* S - short
* C - char
* I - int
* J - long (64 bits)
* F - float
* D - double (64 bits)

Classes take the form `Lpackage/name/ClassName;` - where the leading `L` indicates that it is a class type, `package/name/` is the package that the class is in.

Note, instance (i.e, non-static) method parameters are indexed starting from 1! The 0th parameter is the `this` parameter in dalvik byte-code. For static method parameter, indices start from 0.

### Access path format

An access path describes the symbolic location of a taint. This is commonly used to indicate where a source or a sink originates from.

An access path is composed of a root and a path.

The root is either:
* `Return`, representing the returned value;
* `Argument(x)` (where `x` is an integer), representing the parameter number `x`;

The path is a (possibly empty) list of field names.

Access paths are encoded as strings, where elements are separated by a dot: `<root>.<field1>.<field2>`

Examples:
* `Argument(1).name` correspond to the field `name` of the second parameter;
* `Return.x` correpsond to the field `x` of the returned value;
* `Return` correspond to the returned value.

### Kinds

A source has a **kind** that describes its content (e.g, user input, file system, etc).
A sink also has a **kind** that describes the operation the method performs (e.g, execute a command, read a file, etc.).
Kinds can be arbitrary strings (e.g, `UserInput`). We usually avoid whitespaces.

### Rules

A rule describes flows that we want to catch (e.g, user input flowing into command execution).
A rule is made of a set of source kinds, a set of sink kinds, a name, a code and a description.

Here is an example of a rule in JSON:
```json
{
  "name": "User input flows into code execution (RCE)",
  "code": 1,
  "description": "Values from user-controlled source may eventually flow into code execution",
  "sources": [
    "UserInput",
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "CodeExecution",
  ]
}
```
Rules used by Mariana Trench can be specified with the `--rules-paths` argument. The default set of rules that run can be found in [configuration/rules.json](https://github.com/facebook/mariana-trench/blob/master/configuration/rules.json).

### Sources

Sources describe sources produced or received by a given method. A source can either flow out via the return value or flow via a given parameter. A source has a **kind** that describes its content (e.g, user input, file system, etc).

Here is an example where the source flows by return value:
```java
public static String getPath() {
    return System.getenv().get("PATH");
}
```
The JSON model for this method could be:
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "kind": "UserControlled",
      "port": "Return"
    }
  ]
}
```

Here is an example where the source flows in via an argument:
```java
class MyActivity extends Activity {
  public void onNewIntent(Intent intent) {
    // intent should be considered a source here.
  }
}
```
The JSON model for this method could be:
```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "kind": "UserControlled",
      "port": "Argument(1)"
    }
  ]
}
```
Note that the implicit `this` parameter is considered the argument 0.

### Sinks

Sinks describe dangerous or sensitive methods in the code. A sink has a **kind** that represents the type of operation the method does (e.g, command execution, file system operation, etc). A sink must be attached to a given parameter of the method. A method can have multiple sinks.

Here is an example of a sink:
```java
public static String readFile(String path, String extension, int mode) {
    // Return the content of the file path.extension
}
```
Since `path` and `extension` can be used to read arbitrary files, we consider them sinks. We do not consider `mode` as a sink since we do not care whether the user can control it. The JSON model for this method could be:
```json
{
  "sinks": [
    {
      "kind": "FileRead",
      "port": "Argument(0)"
    },
    {
      "kind": "FileRead",
      "port": "Argument(1)"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Return Sinks

Return sinks can be used to describe that a method should not return tainted information. A return sink is just a normal sink with a `Return` port.

### Propagation

Propagations − also called **tito** (Taint In Taint Out) or **passthrough** in other tools − describe how the method propagates taint. A propagation as an **input** (where the taint comes from) and an **output** (where the taint is moved to).

Here is an example of a propagation:
```java
public static String concat(String x, String y) {
  return x + y;
}
```
The return value of the method can be controlled by both parameters, hence it has the propagations `Argument(0) -> Return` and `Argument(1) -> Return`.  The JSON model for this method could be:
```json
{
  "propagation": [
    {
      "input": "Argument(0)",
      "output": "Return"
    },
    {
      "input": "Argument(1)",
      "output": "Return"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Features

Features (also called **breadcrumbs**) can be used to tag a flow and help filtering issues. A feature describes a property of a flow. A feature can be any arbitrary string.

For instance, the feature `via-numerical-operator` is used to describe that the data flows through a numerical operator such as an addition.

Features are very useful to filter flows in the SAPP UI. E.g. flows with a cast from string to integer are can sometimes be less important during triaging since controlling an integer is more difficult to exploit than controlling a full string.

Note that features **do not stop** the flow, they just help triaging.

#### Attach to Sources

*Attach to sources* is used to add a set of [features](#features) on any sources flowing out of a method through a given parameter or return value.

For instance, if we want to add the feature `via-signed` to all sources flowing out of the given method:
```java
public String getSignedCookie();
```
We could use the following JSON model:
```json
{
  "attach_to_sources": [
    {
      "features": ["via-signed"],
      "port": "Return"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this is only useful for sources inferred by the analysis. If you know that `getSignedCookie` returns a source of a given kind, you should use a source instead.

#### Attach to Sinks

*Attach to sinks* is used to add a set of [features](#features) on all sinks on the given parameter of a method.

For instance, if we want to add the feature `via-user` on all sinks of the given method:
```java
class User {
  public static User findUser(String username) {
    // The code here might use SQL, Thrift, or anything. We don't need to know.
  }
}
```
We could use the following JSON model:
```json
{
  "attach_to_sinks": [
    {
      "features": ["via-user"],
      "port": "Argument(0)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this is only useful for sinks inferred by the analysis. If you know that `findUser` is a sink of a given kind, you should use a sink instead.

#### Attach to Propagations

*Attach to propagations* is used to add a set of [features](#features) on all propagations from or to a given parameter or return value of a method.

For instance, if we want to add the feature `via-concat` to the propagations of the given method:
```java
public static String concat(String x, String y);
```
We could use the following JSON model:
```json
{
  "attach_to_propagations": [
    {
      "features": ["via-concat"],
      "port": "Return" // We could also use Argument(0) and Argument(1)
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this is only useful for propagations inferred by the analysis. If you know that `concat` has a propagation, you should model it as a propagation directly.

#### Add Features to Arguments

*Add features to arguments* is used to add a set of  [features](#features) on all sources that **might** flow on a given parameter of a method.

*Add features to arguments* implies *Attach to sources*, *Attach to sinks* and *Attach to propagations*, but it also accounts for possible side effects at call sites.

For instance:
```java
public static void log(String message) {
  System.out.println(message);
}
public void buyView() {
  String username = getParameter("username");
  String product = getParameter("product");
  log(username);
  buy(username, product);
}
```
Technically, the `log` method doesn't have any source, sink or propagation. We can use *add features to arguments* to add a feature `was-logged` on the flow from `getParameter("username")` to `buy(username, product)`. We could use the following JSON model for the `log` method:
```json
{
  "add_features_to_arguments": [
    {
      "features": ["was-logged"],
      "port": "Argument(0)"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Via-type Features

*Via-type* features are used to keep track of the type of a callable’s port seen at its callsites during taint flow analysis. They are specified in model generators within the “sources” or “sinks” field of a model with the “via_type_of” field. It is mapped to a nonempty list of ports of the method for which we want to create via-type features.

For example, if we were interested in the specific Activity subclasses with which the method below was called:

```java

public void startActivityForResult (Intent intent, int requestCode);

// At some callsite:
ActivitySubclass activitySubclassInstance;
activitySubclassInstance.startActivityForResult(intent, requestCode);

```
we could use the following JSON to specifiy a via-type feature that would materialize as `via-type:ActivitySubclass`:

```json
{
 "sinks": [
   {
     "port": "Argument(1)",
     "kind": "SinkKind",
     "via_type_of": ["Argument(0)"]
   }
 ]
}
```

### Modes

Modes are used to describe specific behaviors of methods. Available modes are:

* `override-default`: do not infer modes of methods using heuristics;
* `skip-analysis`: skip the analysis of the method;
* `add-via-obscure-feature`: add a feature/breadcrumb called `via-obscure:<method>` to sources flowing through this method;
* `taint-in-taint-out`: propagate the taint on arguments to the return value and into the `this` parameter.
* `no-join-virtual-overrides`: do not consider all possible overrides when handling a virtual call to this method.

### Default model

A default model is created for each method, except if it is provided by a model generator.
The default model has a set of heuristics:

If the method has no source code, the model is automatically marked with the following modes:
`skip-analysis`, `add-via-obscure-feature`, `taint-in-taint-out`.

If the method has more than 40 overrides, it is marked with the mode `no-join-virtual-overrides`.

Otherwise, the default model is empty (no sources/sinks/propagations).

## Generators

Mariana Trench allows for dynamic model specifications. This allows a user to specify models of methods before running the analysis. This is used to specify sources, sinks, propagation and modes.

Model generators are specified in a generator configuration file, specified by the `--generator-configuration-path` parameter. By default, we use [`default_generator_config.json`](https://github.com/facebook/mariana-trench/blob/master/configuration/default_generator_config.json).

### Example

Examples of model generators are located in the [`configuration/model-generators`](https://github.com/facebook/mariana-trench/tree/master/configuration/model-generators) directory.

Below is an example of a JSON model generator:
```json
{
  "model_generators": [
      {
        "find": "methods",
        "where": [
          { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "toString" }
        ],
        "model": {
          "propagation": [
            {
              "input": "Argument(0)",
              "output": "Return"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "find": "methods",
        "where": [
          {
            "constraint": "parent",
            "inner": {
              "constraint": "extends",
              "inner": {
                "constraint": "name", "pattern": "SandcastleCommand"
              }
            }
          },
          { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "Time" }
        ],
        "model": {
          "sources": [
            {
              "kind": "Source",
              "port": "Return"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "find": "methods",
        "where": [
          { "constraint": "parent", "inner": { "constraint": "extends", "inner": { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "IEntWithPurposePolicy" }} },
          { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "gen.*" },
          { "constraint": "parameter", "idx": 0, "inner": { "constraint": "type", "kind": "extends", "class": "IViewerContext" } },
          { "constraint": "return", "inner": { "constraint": "extends", "inner": { "constraint": "name", "pattern": "Ent" } } }
        ],
        "model": {
          "modes": ["add-via-obscure-feature"],
          "sinks": [
            {
              "kind": "Sink",
              "port": "Argument(0)",
              "features": ["via-gen"]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
  ]
}
```

### Specification

Each JSON file is a JSON object with a key `model_generators` associated with a list of "rules".

Each "rule" defines a "filter" (which uses "constraints" to specify methods for which a "model" should be generated) and a "model". A rule has the following key/values:

- `find`: The type of thing to find. We only support `methods`;
- `where`: A list of "constraints". All constraints **must be satisfied** by a method in order to generate a model for such method. Constraints can have the following types (see below). Symbols in brackets define the type of the object matched against the constraint.
  - `parent` [Method]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Type] which contains a nested constraint to apply to the class holding the method;
  - `name` [Method|Type]: Expects an extra property `pattern` which is a regex to fully match the name of the item;
  - `signature` [Method]: Expects an extra property `pattern` which is a regex to fully match the full signature (class, method, argument types) of a method;
  - `parameter` [Method]: Expects an extra properties `idx` and `inner` [Type], matches when the idx-th parameter of the function or method matches the nested constraint inner;
  - `extends` [Type]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Type] which contains a nested constraint that must apply to one of the base classes or itself. The optional property `includes_self` is a boolean that tells whether the constraint must be applied on the type itself or not;
  - `super` [Type]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Type] which contains a nested constraint that must apply on the direct superclass;
  - `return` [Method]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Type] which contains a nested constraint to apply to the return of the method;
  - `visibility` [Method]: Expects an extra property `is` which is either `public`, `private` or `protected`;
  - `is_class` [Type]: Accepts an extra property `value` which is either `true` or `false`. By default, `value` is considered `true`;
  - `is_interface` [Type]: Accepts an extra property `value` which is either `true` or `false`. By default, `value` is considered `true`;
  - `is_static` [Method]: Accepts an extra property `value` which is either `true` or `false`. By default, `value` is considered `true`;
  - `is_constructor` [Method]: Accepts an extra property `value` which is either `true` or `false`. By default, `value` is considered `true`;
  - `is_native` [Method]: Accepts an extra property `value` which is either `true` or `false`. By default, `value` is considered `true`;
  - `has_code` [Method]: Accepts an extra property `value` which is either `true` or `false`. By default, `value` is considered `true`;
  - `has_annotation` [Method|Type]: Expects an extra property `type` and an optional property `pattern`, respectively a string and a regex fully matching the value of the annotation.
  - `number_parameters` [Method]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Integer] which contains a nested constraint to apply to the number of parameters (counting the implicit `this` parameter);
  - `number_overrides` [Method]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Integer] which contains a nested constraint to apply on the number of method overrides.
  - `< | <= | == | > | >= | !=` [Integer]: Expects an extra property `value` which contains an integer that the input integer is compared with. The input is the left hand side.
  - `all_of` [Any]: Expects an extra property `inners` [Any] which is an array holding nested constraints which must all apply;
  - `any_of` [Any]: Expects an extra property `inners` [Any] which is an array holding nested constraints where one of them must apply;
  - `not` [Any]: Expects an extra property `inner` [Any] which contains a nested constraint that should not apply.
- `model`: A model, describing sources/sinks/propagations/etc.
  - `sources`*: A list of sources, i.e a source flowing out of the method via return value or flowing in via an argument. A source has the following key/values:
    - `kind`: The source name;
    - `port`**: The source access path (e.g, `"Return"` or `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `features`*: A list of features/breadcrumbs names;
    - `via_type_of`*: A list of ports;
  - `sinks`*: A list of sinks, i.e describing that a parameter of the method flows into a sink. A sink has the following key/values:
    - `kind`: The sink name;
    - `port`: The sink access path (e.g, `"Return"` or `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `features`*:  A list of features/breadcrumbs names;
    - `via_type_of`*: A list of ports;
  - `propagation`*: A list of propagations (also called passthrough) that describe whether a taint on a parameter should result in a taint on the return value or another parameter. A propagation has the following key/values:
    - `input`: The input access path (e.g, `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `output`: The output access path (e.g, `"Return"` or `"Argument(2)"`);
    - `features`*: A list of features/breadcrumbs names;
  - `attach_to_sources`*: A list of attach-to-sources that describe that all sources flowing out of the method on the given parameter or return value must have the given features. An attach-to-source has the following key/values:
    - `port`: The access path root (e.g, `"Return"` or `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `features`: A list of features/breadcrumb names;
  - `attach_to_sinks`*: A list of attach-to-sinks that describe that all sources flowing in the method on the given parameter must have the given features. An attach-to-sink has the following key/values:
    - `port`: The access path root (e.g, `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `features`: A list of features/breadcrumb names;
  - `attach_to_propagations`*: A list of attach-to-propagations that describe that inferred propagations of sources flowing in or out of a given parameter or return value  must have the given features. An attach-to-propagation has the following key/values:
    - `port`: The access path root (e.g, `"Return"` or `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `features`: A list of features/breadcrumb names;
  - `add_features_to_parameters`*: A list of add-features-to-parameters that describe that flows that might flow on the given parameter must have the given features. An add-features-to-parameter has the following key/values:
    - `port`: The access path root (e.g, `"Argument(1)"`);
    - `features`: A list of features/breadcrumb names;
  - `modes`*: A list of mode names that describe specific behaviors of a method;
  - `for_all_parameters`: Generate sources/sinks/propagations/attach_to_* for all parameters of a method that satisfy some constraints. It accepts the following key/values:
    - `variable`: A symbolic name for the parameter;
    - `where`: An optional list of constraints on the type of the parameter;
    - `sources | sinks | propagation`: Same as under "model", but we accept the variable name as a parameter number.
- `verbosity`*: A logging level, to help debugging. 1 is the most verbose, 5 is the least. The default verbosity level is 5.

In the above bullets,

- `*` denotes optional key/value.
- `**` denotes optional key/value. Default is `"Return"`.

Note, the implicit `this` parameter for methods has the parameter number 0.

### Development

#### When Sources or Sinks don't appear in Results

1. This could be because your model generator did not find any method matching your query. You can use the `"verbosity": 1` option in your model generator to check if it matched any method. For instance:
    ```json
    {
      "model_generators":. [
        {
          "find": "methods",
          "where": /* ... */,
          "model": {
            /* ... */
          },
          "verbosity": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    When running mariana trench, this should print:
    ```
    INFO Method `...` satisfies all constraints in json model generator ...
    ```

  2. Make sure that your model generator is actually running. You can use the `--verbosity 2` option to check that. Make sure your model generator is specified in `shim/resources/default_generator_config.json`.
  3. You can also check the output models.
      Use `grep SourceKind models@*` to see if your source or sink kind exists.
      Use `grep 'Lcom/example/<class-name>;.<method-name>:' models@*` to see if a given method exists in the app.
